### Hacking 101

This is the simplest task you will ever be given that remotely qualifies
as hacking. Find the flag to take your first few steps towards becoming a 
l33t hacker. Good luck!

Never seen a Linux shell before? If you come from Windows, you've maybe heard of
"CMD", which is Window's shell. This time however you are not in Windows but in
Linux, and if you have never interacted with it before you should start with
googling yourself to some knowledge about basic shell commands. After that you
should probably google a lot more...

### Strings - description

Hopefully this does not require a lot of explanation.
To solve the task simply `strings a.out` or w/e the binary is called.

I have no idea if the second paragraph is needed there or if this will be
explained somewhere else!
